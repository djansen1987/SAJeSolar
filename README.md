## **SAJ eSolar Sensor Component**<br>
This is a Custom Component for Home-Assistant (https://home-assistant.io) reads and displays sensor values from the SAJ eSolar Portal private API.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This component is built upon a none public API and can change/break at any time.<br>
Please go to the [Supported devides](#devices) part to see if your device is supported<br>

# **ü§òüë©‚Äçüíª Calling Python & REST API Enthusiasts for HA SAJ Solar!üë®‚Äçüíªü§ò**

### Do you use the SAJ solar monitoring project and have knowledge of Python scripting and REST APIs? 
## If so, we need YOU!

I created this repository for a family member but made it publicly available as I saw a wider need. Newer SAJ dongles lack local connections, making this project valuable for others. However, demand has grown, and a major change is coming with SAJ's new website i can't deal with those changes on my one.

## **Challenges & Opportunities**
+ Potential API breakage: The old API will likely be discontinued with the new platform. Some retailers have already seen changes.
+ Configuration complexity: Manual configuration through configuration.yaml isn't ideal.
+ This is where your expertise comes in!

We're looking for a co-author to help maintain and improve the project, particularly with the upcoming website changes. If you have Python scripting and REST API experience, we'd love to hear from you!<br>

## **Join the Effort!**<br>
+ Check out the project: https://github.com/faanskit/ha-esolar (by @faanskit, who made fantastic contributions!)
+ Reach out: Email me at github@djansen.nl if you're interested in collaborating.
+ Together, let's make this project even better!
